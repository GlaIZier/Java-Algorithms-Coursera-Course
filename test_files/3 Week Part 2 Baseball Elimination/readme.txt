Hours to complete assignment (optional):



/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain concisely how you built the FlowNetwork from the input file.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Consider the sports league defined in teams12.txt. Explain in
 *  nontechnical terms (using the results of certificate of elimination
 *  and grade-school arithmetic) why Japan is mathematically
 *  eliminated.

/**********************************************************************
 *  What is the order of growth of the amount of memory (in the worst

Number of vertices =  
Number of edges    =  

Amount of memory


/**********************************************************************
 *  What is the order of growth of the running time (in the worst case)
 *  of your program to determine whether *one* team is eliminated
 *  as a function of of the number of teams N?
 *
 *  Assume that the order of growth of the running time (in the worst
 *  case) to compute a maxflow in a network with V vertices and E edges
 *  is V E^2.
 *
 *  Briefly justify your answer.

/**********************************************************************
 *  If you did the extra credit, describe the input file and
